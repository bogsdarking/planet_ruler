Let's start out with this image taken by an astronaut using a Nikon D4 camera aboard the International Space Station. A couple things to note:

- You can clearly see the 'limb' of Earth here -- the edge where the planet meets space.
- You can definitely see some curvature, but because the ISS is in a relatively low orbit, it is not as pronounced as some of the other planets we have looked at.
