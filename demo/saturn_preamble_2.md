Let's start out with this image from NASA's Cassini-Huygens mission. A couple things to note:

- You can clearly see the 'limb' of Saturn here -- the edge where the planet meets space.
- This is a huge planet, but we are high enough (around 805,000 km) and using a wide-angle camera to make the curvature apparent.
